# Bayesian Logistic Regression for Liver Cirrhosis Survival Prediction

This project applies **Bayesian logistic regression** to a clinical dataset on liver cirrhosis survival outcomes.  
The analysis investigates the effect of clinical, demographic, and biochemical variables on patient mortality using  
rigorous model specification, prior selection, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- **Goal**: Identify key predictors of mortality in liver cirrhosis patients
- **Dataset**: 418 records, 17 clinical variables (Kaggle)
- **Outcome**: Binary (Survived = 0, Death = 1)

## ðŸ›  Methods
- Bayesian logistic regression (`brms` in R)
- Prior specification and sensitivity analysis
- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (`loo`) for model comparison
- Sensitivity & specificity analysis on hold-out data
- Data preprocessing: one-hot encoding, standardization, feature engineering

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- R, `brms`, `loo`, `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `caret`, `synthpop`
- LaTeX for scientific reporting

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
- Top predictors: bilirubin, age, alkaline phosphatase, ascites, edema
- Best-performing model: Specificity ~77%, Sensitivity ~65%
- Priors and model complexity impacted performance and interpretation
